# Coffee Shop Full Stack

The full stack coffee shop is a app which has 2 major set of users, a manager and a barista, which is used to store drink menus.
Depending on the role, a user can be a barista or a manager. The project focuses on Role based access control and also improving systems by employing a microservices architecture, in this case, using a third-party authentication service ``Auth0`` for authentication and access control.

## Barista
The barista can ``GET drinks`` and ``GET drinks-details``


## Manager

The manager can perform all the duties of the barista. But in addition to that he can also make new recipes for drinks.
